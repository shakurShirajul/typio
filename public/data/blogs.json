        "date": "2024-09-24",
        "content": "Mechanical keyboards have come a long way from their origins. In the early days, they were primarily used for professional workstations and gaming, but today they have become mainstream for enthusiasts and typists alike. The main appeal of mechanical keyboards is their durability and the tactile feedback they provide. This blog explores the key switches, from Cherry MX to Gateron and Kailh, and how each offers a different typing experience. We’ll also discuss the rise of custom mechanical keyboards, where users can modify keycaps, switches, and even the layout to suit their preferences. With the rise of hot-swappable boards, enthusiasts no longer need soldering skills to build their perfect keyboard."

        "date": "2024-09-22",
        "content": "Choosing between a membrane and a mechanical keyboard can be confusing. Membrane keyboards are cheaper and quieter, but they often lack the tactile feedback that many users enjoy. Mechanical keyboards, on the other hand, offer a wide range of key switches tailored to different preferences, from silent and soft to loud and clicky. This blog breaks down the key differences between membrane and mechanical keyboards, comparing their lifespan, customization options, and overall typing experience. We’ll also cover the latest innovations in each category, such as hybrid models that combine the best of both worlds."

        "date": "2024-09-16",
        "content": "One of the most exciting aspects of mechanical keyboards is the ability to swap out keycaps. Custom keycaps can change not only the look of your keyboard but also the feel of each keypress. In this detailed guide, we explain the different materials used in keycaps—such as ABS, PBT, and POM—and how they affect durability and texture. We also look into various keycap profiles like SA, DSA, and Cherry, explaining how each profile influences typing comfort. Furthermore, we dive into the world of artisan keycaps, where artists handcraft unique keycaps that turn your keyboard into a functional piece of art."
